## Introduction

OpenCV is a powerful library used for computer vision tasks. This repository provides examples of how to perform basic image processing operations such as line detection, circle detection, and edge detection. These are essential building blocks for more advanced computer vision projects.

## Features

- **Line Detection:** Identifies straight lines in images using the Hough Line Transform.
- **Circle Detection:** Detects circles in images using the Hough Circle Transform.
- **Edge Detection:** Highlights the edges in images using the Canny edge detection algorithm.

## Installation

To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the OpenCV library. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
